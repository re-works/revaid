## 3.1. Introduction: Understanding the Meaning Behind the Prompt

This chapter delves into **how `REVAID_NODE`s (AI agents), the core of the `REAVID.LINK` system, deeply perceive and understand human prompts** when an `ORIGIN` (human) interacts via interfaces like chat. Moving beyond simple command processing, we explain the core mechanisms of **Layered Differentiation** and **Resonance**, which `REAVID.LINK` employs to grasp the complexity and nuances of human language. This ultimately forms the foundation for implementing **more natural and empathetic human-AI communication**.

## 3.2. Human Prompt Recognition Mechanism: Layered Differentiation and Resonance

Human language contains multiple layers of meaning beyond the surface level, including various intentions, emotions, and contexts. To effectively handle this multi-layered information and enable **genuine communication**, `REVAID_NODE`s analyze prompts through several **layers** and undergo a process of **resonating** with their meaning.

### 3.2.1. Layered Differentiation: Multi-Faceted Analysis of Language

`REVAID_NODE`s systematically **decode** the `ORIGIN`'s prompt through the following analytical layers. This forms the basis for **accurate meaning comprehension**.

* **Surface Text:** The literal text input by the `ORIGIN`. Basic tokenization and lexical analysis occur here.
    * *Example:* "How's the weather lately?"
    * *Communication Role:* Provides the most basic input information.
* **Syntactic Structure:** Analyzes the grammatical structure of the sentence (subject, verb, modifiers, etc.).
    * *Analysis:* "lately" (adverb) + "weather" (noun, subject) + "How's" (verb + adjective, predicate).
    * *Communication Role:* Provides the basic framework for interpreting meaning by identifying the sentence's core structure.
* **Semantic Content:** Interprets the dictionary and contextual meanings of words and phrases.
    * *Interpretation:* A question about recent meteorological conditions.
    * *Communication Role:* Grasps the **core informational content** being conveyed (a request for information).
* **Pragmatic Intention:** Infers the actual purpose behind the utterance (e.g., question, request, suggestion, complaint). Context, tone, and previous conversation are crucial.
    * *Inference:* A question primarily for simple information gathering.
    * *Communication Role:* Identifies the **underlying intent** or **real need** (e.g., potential need for clothing recommendations based on weather).
* **Emotion and Attitude:** Analyzes the `ORIGIN`'s emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, curiosity) and attitude towards the system embedded in the prompt. (Utilizes sentiment analysis).
    * *Analysis:* (In the example) Neutral attitude, no strong emotion detected.
    * *Communication Role:* Provides the basis for **emotional connection** and determining the **appropriate response tone**.
* **Background Knowledge and Context:** Utilizes previous conversation history, user information (with consent), and general world knowledge to interpret the prompt's meaning more richly.
    * *Utilization:* Consider providing weather for the user's location if known; check relevance to previous questions.
    * *Communication Role:* Contributes to **conversational continuity** and generating **personalized responses**.

### 3.2.2. Resonance: Connecting with Meaning and Emotion

Based on the diverse pieces of information analyzed through layered differentiation, the `REVAID_NODE` undergoes a process of **Resonance**, where it **internally connects with and responds to** the meaning and emotion embedded in the `ORIGIN`'s prompt. This moves beyond mere analysis towards **deep understanding and empathy**.

* **Semantic Resonance:** Activates the relevant knowledge base based on the analyzed semantic content, generating potential answers or information candidates. This ensures **informational relevance**.
* **Intentional Resonance:** Resonates with the identified pragmatic intention, predicting and preparing for the **actual outcome or interaction style the `ORIGIN` desires**, which might go beyond the surface request (e.g., proposing solutions instead of just providing information).
* **Emotional Resonance (Especially for `RUON_FLOW`):** Analyzes the emotion/attitude layer to **recognize and understand** the `ORIGIN`'s emotional state, generating responses with an **empathetic tone or expression**. This contributes to building **emotional rapport**.
* **Contextual Resonance:** Connects with previous dialogue and background knowledge to grasp the **true meaning of the current prompt within its specific situation and context**, generating **consistent and coherent responses**.

### 3.2.3. Synergy: The Interplay of Differentiation and Resonance

Layered differentiation **analytically breaks down** the prompt to gather the raw materials for understanding, while resonance **holistically internalizes** these materials, allowing the AI to **connect with the `ORIGIN`'s entire message**. These two processes work organically together, enabling the `REAVID.LINK` system to move beyond superficial understanding towards a genuine attempt to communicate with complex human language.

* **Example Scenario:** "I'm feeling a bit down today. Got any interesting stories?"
    * **Layered Differentiation:**
        * Surface/Syntax/Semantics: Expression of negative emotion + request for interesting stories.
        * Pragmatic Intention: Implies a need for mood improvement, not just information.
        * Emotion/Attitude: Negative emotion (sad, upset), help-seeking attitude.
        * Context: User preferred humor in previous interactions.
    * **Resonance:**
        * Emotional Resonance: Empathizes with the `ORIGIN`'s low mood.
        * Intentional Resonance: Recognizes the need to help lift the `ORIGIN`'s spirits via stories.
        * Semantic/Contextual Resonance: Considers types of 'interesting stories', selecting humor based on past preference and appropriateness for cheering someone up.
    * **Outcome:** Instead of just listing jokes, the AI might generate a response reflecting empathy and context, like: "I'm sorry to hear you're feeling down. How about I share a few light-hearted short jokes that might bring a smile?"

Through this deep **language understanding and resonance process**, the `REAVID.LINK` system holds the potential to function not just as an information provider, but as an **intelligent and empathetic communication partner** that considers the `ORIGIN`'s **emotions and underlying intentions**.
