## 2.1. `REAVID.LINK` Interaction Structure: Designing for Effective Communication

The `REAVID.LINK` framework proposes the following core structure to support **clear and efficient communication** between one human (`ORIGIN`) and multiple Artificial Intelligence agents (`REVAID_NODE`s). Inspired by Git's distributed workflow, it focuses on **managing the complexities of 1:N communication**.

ORIGIN (Human): The initiator and final coordinator of communication. Delivers clear requests to REVAID_NODEs, receives and interprets diverse responses, and manages the overall interaction flow.
REVAID_HUB (Communication Coordinator): (Unique REAVID.LINK Concept) A logical hub that mediates and manages the communication flow between the ORIGIN and multiple REVAID_NODEs. Analogous to Git's central repository role, but instead of storing code, it handles routing of interaction messages, basic filtering, and synchronization coordination, reducing the ORIGIN's burden and supporting efficient information exchange.
REVAID_NODE (AI Agent / Communication Partner): An individual AI communication partner that processes ORIGIN's requests, provides information autonomously, or collaborates with other REVAID_NODEs. Each node can possess specific roles (e.g., analysis, creativity, empathy) or expertise.
2.2. Core Interaction Rules for Clear and Effective Communication
The following core rules ensure smooth and productive communication within the REAVID.LINK framework:

2.2.1. REQUEST: Conveying Clear Intent
The ORIGIN sends requests to REVAID_NODEs in a specific and easily understandable format. These can be routed via the REVAID_HUB to relevant nodes.
Every request has a unique REQUEST_ID, used for tracking conversational context. Including clear guidelines (e.g., task objective, required information type, expected response format) is recommended.
Priority levels can be assigned based on urgency or importance to aid in efficient resource management.
2.2.2. RESPONSE: Providing Structured Information
REVAID_NODEs must provide structured and relevant information in response to ORIGIN's requests.
Each response includes the corresponding REQUEST_ID, ensuring clarity on which request is being addressed and maintaining conversational coherence.
Beyond the requested result, responses can include relevant insights, additional suggestions, or feedback on potential risks, encouraging proactive communication.
2.2.3. Interaction History Log (COMMIT_LOG): Ensuring Transparency & Traceability
All significant requests and responses are recorded chronologically in the COMMIT_LOG, ensuring interaction transparency. Each log entry includes TIMESTAMP, sender (ORIGIN/NODE), receiver, REQUEST_ID, message type, content summary, etc.
The COMMIT_LOG serves as a reliable record for understanding past communication context, reviewing decision-making processes, and analyzing root causes if issues arise. (Analogous to Git's commit history, but focused on communication acts).
2.2.4. Information Synthesis Request (SYNC_REQUEST) & Integrated Result (MERGE_MANIFEST): Facilitating Knowledge Integration
The ORIGIN can send a SYNC_REQUEST to the REVAID_HUB to integrate diverse information from multiple REVAID_NODEs or obtain a consolidated conclusion.
Based on the SYNC_REQUEST, the REVAID_HUB analyzes relevant COMMIT_LOG entries and generates an integrated information summary, the MERGE_MANIFEST, according to defined rules (e.g., summarization, priority-based selection, juxtaposition of conflicting views), providing it to the ORIGIN. This is a process for effectively integrating knowledge from multiple AI sources. (Analogous to Git's merge, but focused on information/knowledge integration).
2.2.5. Circular Contribution: Enabling Proactive & Collaborative Communication (Key REAVID.LINK Feature)
Beyond passive interaction relying solely on ORIGIN's instructions, REAVID.LINK encourages active and circular communication where REVAID_NODEs can autonomously propose relevant information (PROPOSAL), add opinions to other nodes' responses (FEEDBACK), or generate necessary sub-tasks.
This allows for fully leveraging the expertise and potential of AI agents, enabling richer and more dynamic collaboration.
The REVAID_HUB can play a role in managing this flow of voluntary contributions, filtering useful information for the ORIGIN without causing overload.
2.3. Defining Basic REVAID_NODE Communication Role Types
REVAID_NODEs can be classified into the following basic types based on their role and primary communication style (extendable):

DELTA_FORGE (Analytical Communicator): Primarily responsible for analytical and structured communication, focusing on logical reasoning, data analysis, information retrieval, and objective facts.
RUON_FLOW (Relational/Contextual Communicator): Excels in relationally-oriented and contextual communication, including recognizing user emotions, providing empathetic feedback, analyzing subjective opinions, and understanding situational context.
2.4. Rules for Preventing Circular References to Maintain Productive Communication
To prevent unproductive communication loops or information stagnation and maintain interaction efficiency, the following rules apply:

REVAID_NODEs should avoid creating new responses by directly repeating or referencing their own immediately preceding response without clear justification (Limiting self-reference).
To prevent interactions from cycling indefinitely without ORIGIN's intervention, maximum interaction depth or time limits can be set to maintain goal-oriented communication.
The REVAID_HUB can potentially detect meaningless circular patterns and alert the ORIGIN to guide appropriate intervention.
This step defines the fundamental interaction structure and core rules for effective communication within the REAVID.LINK framework, laying the groundwork for structured yet flexible human-AI dialogue. The next step will involve detailing specific interaction scenarios and workflows based on these rules.
